Princess, I think I just now mastered it.

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:48.951
[splash!]

00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:51.046
One more bounce. All right.

00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:52.454
[grunts]

00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.253
Tea-partying's hard, huh, Jake?

00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:55.759
Oof! Yes.

00:11:55.827 --> 00:11:57.795
What? No way. It's super-easy.

00:11:57.863 --> 00:12:00.195
Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker.

00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:02.028
You're floating, not bouncing.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.761
Fine. l'll prove it.

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:04.961
Huh? Aah!

00:12:05.037 --> 00:12:06.937
Oh, no! Oh, snap! [crunch!]

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:07.801
Aah!

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:10.364
Ah, lame. Sorry I bit your leg.

00:12:10.442 --> 00:12:12.273
<i>You're stlll biting me!</i>

00:12:12.344 --> 00:12:14.175
Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:15.406
Dude, your leg!

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.311
JAKE: This is... new.

00:12:17.382 --> 00:12:19.373
Nothing ominous,
though -- just a bump.

00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:21.146
Nah -- that's
no bump.

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:23.312
It's the early stage of the lumps.

00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:24.582
ls it serious?

00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:27.648
lt just means he's changing
into a Lumpy Space guy,

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:29.523
on account of my bite.

00:12:29.594 --> 00:12:32.392
It's just like, um, you
know, werewolf rules.

00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:34.125
Arrr!
Arr-arr-arr! Arr!

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.393
- Oh, no!
- What?

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:37.731
You think l'm gonna
turn all lumpy, like her?

00:12:37.803 --> 00:12:39.395
Get outta here! Wha?!

00:12:39.471 --> 00:12:41.336
Finn, I think l'm freaking out!

00:12:41.406 --> 00:12:42.668
Calm down, bud.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.402
l'll... l'll sock the lumpiness out of you.

00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:45.465
PRlNCESS: Hey, now.

00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:48.513
[grunting] Royal intervention.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.242
Surely there must be an
antidote to the lumps.

00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:53.443
Yeah, there's an antidote,
but you have to go

00:12:53.518 --> 00:12:55.918
all the way to Lumpy Space to get it,

00:12:55.987 --> 00:12:58.421
<i>andJake has to use it by sunset.</i>

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.425
<i>What happens if he doesn't
take the antidote by sunset?</i>

00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:03.461
He'll be lumpy, like, forever.

00:13:03.528 --> 00:13:06.326
LSP, please, can you tell
us how to reach Lumpy Space?

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:08.423
Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.933
l can show you whenever.

00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:11.992
BOTH: Take us now! Take us now!

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.401
[stomach growls]

00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:15.303
l should not have drank that much tea.

00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:17.933
Don't go telling everyone
about this portal or whatever.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.670
It's kind of a secret.

00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:22.436
Where is it?

00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:24.277
The portal is that frog and mushroom.

00:13:24.349 --> 00:13:25.338
Ribbit!

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:26.782
Password, please.

00:13:26.852 --> 00:13:28.376
Whatevers 2009!

00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:29.852
Good day, Princess.

00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:33.118
ls your father okay with
you entering Lumpy Space

00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:35.489
with two... [creak!]

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.323
...non-lumpers?

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:39.124
Just say ''yes!'' Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:13:39.197 --> 00:13:40.858
Yeah, whatever. Fine.

00:13:40.932 --> 00:13:42.559
[slurp! whip! whip! whip!]

00:13:42.634 --> 00:13:44.192
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.737
Aah!

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:50.639
Whoa! Lumpy Space!

00:13:51.977 --> 00:13:54.241
So, where's the antidote?
- Hold it.

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:55.904
First, you should check out my house.

00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:57.915
It's, like, kind of lame,

00:13:57.983 --> 00:13:59.974
<i>but way less lame than, like, your house.</i>

00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:01.848
Uh, can you skip to the part

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.785
where you'll tell us where the antidote is?

00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:05.379
It's up there at make-out point.

00:14:05.457 --> 00:14:06.515
That's so close!

00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:08.582
We can run there in no... time.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.252
Aw, what?!

00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:12.592
It's like a million-mile fall into space!

00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:14.825
Yeah, you have to travel
by car in my world,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.993
or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.

00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:18.057
LUMPY SPACE KlNG: Daughter!

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:21.663
<i>Have you brought smooth
people into our domain?!</i>

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.731
l had to, Dad.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:25.800
l'm trying to help them.

00:14:25.877 --> 00:14:28.107
So don't lumping yell at me!

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.738
What did you say?!

00:14:29.815 --> 00:14:31.373
What did you just say?!

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:33.440
l said, ''lump off, mom!''

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:35.509
[shouting indistinctly]

00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:37.248
[huffing]

00:14:37.322 --> 00:14:38.983
- Uhh...
- What?!

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:41.548
- Vroom...vroom?
- Oh, yeah, I need to borrow the car.

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.617
You have made your mother cry

00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:45.720
for the last time, daughter!

00:14:45.797 --> 00:14:48.425
You are hereby banned
from using the royal car!

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.196
Shucks! I lumping hate them!

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:53.260
l'm really, really sorry, Finn,

00:14:53.338 --> 00:14:55.704
but I can't help you, because my parents

00:14:55.774 --> 00:14:57.605
are horrible idiots!

00:14:57.676 --> 00:14:59.303
<i>Don't you know anyone else with a car?</i>

00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:01.368
My friend Melissa has a car,

00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:03.471
but she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:05.573
Call her... now!

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.642
Hmm. Call ''BBF 66.''

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.086
[cellphone rings] Hello?

00:15:11.156 --> 00:15:12.919
Hey, Melissa. What's up?

00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:14.982
- What's she saying?
- l'm asking her! Geez!

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.391
Melissa, just listen.

00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.429
MELlSSA: Have you
forgotten what day this is?

00:15:18.496 --> 00:15:20.157
Melissa, l'm trying to
help out some friends.

00:15:20.232 --> 00:15:23.497
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming dance!

00:15:23.568 --> 00:15:26.059
- Oh, glob. I forgot.
- What'd she say?

00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:28.435
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming dance!

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.736
It's gonna be so flippin' awesome!

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:32.800
LSP, we don't have time for this.

00:15:32.878 --> 00:15:35.176
Ask for the ride, LSP.

00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:37.875
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:38.938
Wha?!

00:15:39.017 --> 00:15:41.315
[as LSP] Melissa, you
should totally drive us

00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:43.149
to make-out point...

00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:45.781
to make out with hot boys.

00:15:45.857 --> 00:15:49.384
LSP, you're so
ba-a-a-a-a-d!

00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:50.860
Be there in a
sec! - Bye-ah!

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:52.191
[cellphone beeps] Hmph.

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:55.131
[normal voice] Sorry, but
Jake's lumpiness is worsening.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.169
Actually, I think l'm beating
it back with sheer willpower.

00:15:58.236 --> 00:16:00.466
[pop!] Oh, my.

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:01.562
Yeah, whatever.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.437
Just don't mess with my phone again.

00:16:03.508 --> 00:16:05.305
Hey!

00:16:05.377 --> 00:16:06.867
Ugh. Okay.

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:09.436
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:16:09.514 --> 00:16:12.108
[up-tempo music plays]

00:16:12.183 --> 00:16:14.447
Aw, Finn, this music ''ducks,'' right?

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:17.386
[Lumpy voice] Aw, I love this song.

00:16:17.455 --> 00:16:19.616
We should totally T. P. Shawndala's house.

00:16:19.691 --> 00:16:20.988
[normal voice] Gracious!

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:22.026
That was terrible!

00:16:22.093 --> 00:16:24.960
Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.055
<i>if I do turn,</i>

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:29.225
if I become lumpy like them,

00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:31.292
l want you to -- - It's
not gonna come to that!

00:16:31.369 --> 00:16:33.303
But if it does, l'll bury you

00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.362
beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:16:37.042 --> 00:16:39.408
<i>l'm saying that if I go totally lumpy,</i>

00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:42.173
then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake.

00:16:42.247 --> 00:16:43.908
<i>What dld you thlnk I was saylng?</i>

00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:44.812
Oh, um...

00:16:44.883 --> 00:16:45.747
[chuckles nervously]

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.409
Can't this car go any faster?!

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:48.850
MELlSSA: We're already here.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.909
Hi, Finn.

00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.922
We've been here for, like, five minutes.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.685
Finally! Huh?

00:16:53.758 --> 00:16:55.589
This doesn't look like make-out point.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.594
This is Brad's house.

00:16:57.662 --> 00:17:00.062
<i>You wanted a ride to make-out point?</i>

00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:02.599
<i>You think I want to make out with you?!</i>

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:03.656
Uhh...

00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:07.603
Well, maybe I do, but... wait!

00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:09.606
l have a boyfriend, Finn!

00:17:09.674 --> 00:17:10.504
[whoosh! clank!]

00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:12.270
LSP, we got to hurry!

00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:13.709
Jake's running out of time!

00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:15.575
<i>Hey, this is hard for me, too.</i>

00:17:15.647 --> 00:17:18.343
l mean, I used to eat
chili-cheese fries with Brad,

00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:20.577
so there's gonna be a lot of
romantic tension on this ride.

00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:21.744
BRAD: Hey.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.380
Oh, Brad. [giggles]

00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:26.447
You miss me yet, LSP?

00:17:26.524 --> 00:17:28.492
Scooch over, Finn.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.188
l'm gonna sit in the back.

00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:32.991
This is it.

00:17:33.064 --> 00:17:34.122
Let's go.

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:35.791
Wait. Watch yourself, Finn.

00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:37.892
The guys who use the antidote up here

00:17:37.969 --> 00:17:40.096
are notorious for being...

00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:42.139
smooth posers.

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:43.367
<i>What does that mean?</i>

00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:45.375
lt just means what it means. Hurry.

00:17:45.443 --> 00:17:47.434
Get the antidote so we can get out of here.

00:17:47.512 --> 00:17:48.536
Thanks, LSP.

00:17:48.613 --> 00:17:50.478
Bu-u-u-u-mps.

00:17:50.548 --> 00:17:51.640
Um... bumps.

00:17:51.716 --> 00:17:53.479
Uh, yeah... bumps.

00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:54.381
Aw, man!

00:17:54.452 --> 00:17:56.113
[panting]

00:17:56.187 --> 00:17:57.154
Hey, guys.

00:17:57.222 --> 00:17:59.122
- Lookin' smooth.
- Really?

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.487
You think we're smooth?

00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:02.549
Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah.

00:18:02.627 --> 00:18:04.219
Why are you sucking up to us?

00:18:04.295 --> 00:18:06.092
My best friend needs an
antidote for lumpiness.

00:18:06.164 --> 00:18:08.394
Yeah, lumpiness sucks.

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.058
Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere hog.

00:18:10.135 --> 00:18:11.625
My turn.

00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:12.761
[zap!]

00:18:12.837 --> 00:18:15.704
So, the antidote is in that
orb you were sitting on.

00:18:15.774 --> 00:18:18.470
<i>This orb ls the antidote, brah.</i>

00:18:18.543 --> 00:18:19.510
Can my friend borrow it?

00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:21.477
Yeah, sure, as long as
you give it right back.

00:18:21.546 --> 00:18:23.605
Ham-a-cow!
Thanks, fellas.

00:18:23.681 --> 00:18:25.672
What's taking so long?

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.581
Did those smooth-heads give
you the orb already or what?

00:18:27.652 --> 00:18:28.584
Wait!

00:18:28.653 --> 00:18:31.019
ls this another ''friend'' of yours?

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:32.886
What do you care? Just give
him the antidote already

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:34.754
and stop being such a poser.

00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:37.624
Sorry, kid. We changed our minds.

00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:40.186
Why did you have to say all
those rude things to them?!

00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:41.823
What? I was helping you.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.832
Thanks a lot!

00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:44.664
They were right about to
hand over the antidote!

00:18:44.736 --> 00:18:45.703
You're welcome a lot.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.761
You insulted them, and they got mad,

00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:49.466
and now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever!

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:51.133
This is all your fault!

00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:52.870
<i>Wow. Now I know how you really feel.</i>

00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:54.969
l was just trying to help, but whatever.

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:56.377
[sniffles]

00:18:56.448 --> 00:18:58.541
No. No, not ''whatever.''

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:00.277
[voice breaking] I know l
mess things up sometimes,

00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:02.148
but l'm really trying,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.211
and you're supposed
to be my friend --

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:05.984
not like the fake ones I have here.

00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:09.891
So do what you want!
l'm going to Promcoming!

00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:12.395
Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?

00:19:12.464 --> 00:19:13.294
No.

00:19:13.364 --> 00:19:16.356
Because no matter how
messed-up and lumpy I get,

00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:18.425
<i>thls guy never turns his back on me.</i>

00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:20.494
[lumpy voice] Oh, yeah. Right behind you.

00:19:20.572 --> 00:19:22.369
Just got to turn my back on this guy.

00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:26.069
Jake! It's almost sunset!

00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.078
Jake -- didn't
save him.

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:29.408
l...

00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:31.915
[growling, snarling]

00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:36.477
l'll kill you,
Lumpy Spa-a-a-ce!

00:19:36.554 --> 00:19:37.919
- MONTY: Jam on, man.
- Huh?

00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:38.887
l thought you guys left.

00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:41.084
We were drawn back by your Plaintive Wail.

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:43.059
We dig your directionless fury.

00:19:43.128 --> 00:19:44.254
Um, thanks.

00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:46.297
Respect. Here.

00:19:46.364 --> 00:19:47.991
Pyoo! Take it.

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:49.260
Win your girl back.

00:19:49.334 --> 00:19:50.528
Yeah, there's no girl.

00:19:50.602 --> 00:19:52.502
<i>But there ls still time to save Jake.</i>

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.299
Do you guys know where Promcoming is?

00:19:54.372 --> 00:19:57.170
Promcoming takes place
way down on that land lump.

00:19:57.242 --> 00:19:58.402
FlNN: Awesome.

00:19:58.476 --> 00:20:00.307
Do any of y'all have wheels?

00:20:00.378 --> 00:20:02.369
Nah, we were all ditched
here, just like you.

00:20:02.447 --> 00:20:04.438
Well, you think I could
make it to that land lump

00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:06.450
if I jumped off this cliff?
- You kidding?

00:20:06.518 --> 00:20:07.849
A smoothie like you will plummet

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:09.409
right into the eternal void!

00:20:09.487 --> 00:20:11.478
<i>What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?</i>

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:14.252
No, no! It's too dangerous!

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:17.226
l'd say there's a 50/50
chance of you making it.

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:19.263
That's good enough for me. Now bite me!

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.321
- Are you crazy, man?!
- What are you talking about?!

00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:23.731
Raaaaaaah! Aaah!
Aaah! Ooooh--

00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:25.029
Yes!

00:20:25.103 --> 00:20:26.570
l can feel the multiple bites

00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:28.606
accelerating the lumpification process!

00:20:28.673 --> 00:20:30.004
l'm starting to float!

00:20:30.074 --> 00:20:31.268
Don't jump, guy!

00:20:31.342 --> 00:20:33.071
<i>l have to --
for my buddy.</i>

00:20:33.144 --> 00:20:35.305
Raaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.507
Wow. He's insane.

00:20:37.582 --> 00:20:38.913
[crash!]

00:20:38.983 --> 00:20:41.247
l made it! And there he is!

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:43.082
Yeah, Promcoming. Yeah, cool.

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:44.985
Jake, l'm mostly lumpy now,

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:47.616
and I totally think you
should sit on this sphere.

00:20:47.692 --> 00:20:50.126
- No! Hey!
- Sit on it!

00:20:50.195 --> 00:20:51.253
[grunting] No!

00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:53.388
Please, Jake! You're my best friend!

00:20:53.464 --> 00:20:55.364
Just sit on the sphere!

00:20:55.433 --> 00:20:57.162
<i>Pshaw! I remember you.</i>

00:20:57.235 --> 00:20:59.703
You're just a smoothie-
wannabe-lumpy poser.

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.331
<i>Sit on it! Before I turn completely lumpy!</i>

00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:03.999
- No!
- Oh, no!

00:21:04.075 --> 00:21:07.306
l can feel the lumpiness
about to consume me!

00:21:07.378 --> 00:21:08.310
[lumpy voice] Oh, yeah.

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:09.641
Being lumpy is the best.

00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:12.046
Hey, stop talking to yourself, dumb guy.

00:21:12.116 --> 00:21:13.481
Take your ball and get out of here.

00:21:13.551 --> 00:21:15.348
Fine! I don't want you to have it anyways!

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.717
So I can't have it now, eh?

00:21:16.788 --> 00:21:18.779
That's right! It's mine!

00:21:18.856 --> 00:21:20.118
Gimme that ball!

00:21:20.191 --> 00:21:21.556
No! You can't have it!

00:21:21.626 --> 00:21:22.615
Give it to me!
- No!

00:21:22.694 --> 00:21:24.355
l want it! Give it to me!

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:26.294
You want it that bad? Go get it, then!

00:21:26.364 --> 00:21:27.456
Bumps!
Byahhh--

00:21:27.532 --> 00:21:28.464

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.465
[gasps]

00:21:29.534 --> 00:21:32.230
[normal voice] Oh, l'm not lumpy anymore!

00:21:32.303 --> 00:21:33.770
Oh, no! Finn, buddy!

00:21:33.838 --> 00:21:36.068
You got to sit on this!
- No!

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.404
You can't make
me, smoothi-- oof!

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.672
JAKE: [echoing] Finn?

00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:42.474
Hey, Finn. Hey, buddy.

00:21:42.547 --> 00:21:43.707
- Finn!
- Huh?

00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:45.373
[normal voice] Hey, dude. We made it.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.180
Man, there's something cold under my butt.

00:21:48.253 --> 00:21:49.413
Oh! [laughs]

00:21:49.487 --> 00:21:51.478
The antidote. Just in time, too.

00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:53.854
LSP, l'm sorry I blew up at you before.

00:21:53.925 --> 00:21:54.983
l didn't mean it.

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:56.720
l was just really stressed out.

00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:58.091
You know, it's fine.

00:21:58.162 --> 00:21:59.686
You and Jake can make it up to me

00:21:59.764 --> 00:22:01.755
by dancing this last dance with me.

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.097
Sounds good to me. What do you say, Jake?

00:22:04.168 --> 00:22:05.999
[lumpy voice] That sounds totally lame.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.560
- [both gasp]
- [laughs]

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:09.573
[normal voice] I'm just
kidding. Let's dance!
