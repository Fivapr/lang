00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.920
No, it's destiny. Oh, you
must know how it goes.

689
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.790
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

690
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.800
is rescued by a brave knight,

691
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.180
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

692
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.340
Hmm? With Shrek? You think...
Wait.

693
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.600
Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

694
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.680
Well, yes.

696
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.190
You think Shrek is
your true love!

697
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.190
What is so funny?

698
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.360
Let's just say I'm
not your type, okay?

699
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

700
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.490
Now... Now remove your helmet.

701
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

702
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.870
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

703
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.120
- Take it off.
- No!

704
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.290
- Now!
- Okay!

705
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.880
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.
